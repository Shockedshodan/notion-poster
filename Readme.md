# Organizational tools and docs

This repo is for our tools and docs that we use at HIRO.

## Notion journal utility
`notion-journal` dir contains a utility to enable employees 
posting their daily journal entries without having to switch to Notion Web.
See 'Readme.md' in the dir for more information.

`notionposter-windows` dir contains a plugin for a Flow Launcher
 that allows us to quick post entries into db.
